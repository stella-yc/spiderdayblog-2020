On NPR's daily science podcast, **Short Wave**, I chatted with Maddie Sofia about why spiders are 8-legs-and-2-palps-down the best animals. Full stop. [Listen here](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/science-friday-summer-institute-2020/).

On **Just the Zoo of Us**, a show where scientists rate the animals they study, we got to focus on just jumping spiders, and their fantastic abilities. [Listen here](https://anchor.fm/justthezooofus/episodes/87-Jumping-Spiders-w-Dr--Sebastian-Echeverri-ercevf).

On **Marvels of Science**, I got to talk about, of course, Spider-Man, and how real-life spiders match up to the hero. [Listen here.](https://anchor.fm/marvels-of-science/episodes/Episode-9-Spider-Man-Does-Whatever-He-Wants-er2gp3)

And on the family show Lil Dudes Insect Academy, I got to talk a bit more about my journey as a scientist (and also cool jumping spider stuff). We talked enough for a two-part show; here's [part one](https://anchor.fm/lildudesacademy/embed/episodes/54--The-amazing-life-of-Jumping-Spiders--Pt-1-Feat--Dr--Sebastian-Echeverri-er6dc3), and [part two](https://anchor.fm/lildudesacademy/embed/episodes/55--The-amazing-life-of-Jumping-Spiders--Pt-2-Feat--Dr--Sebastian-Echeverri-es23gs).[](https://anchor.fm/lildudesacademy/embed/episodes/54--The-amazing-life-of-Jumping-Spiders--Pt-1-Feat--Dr--Sebastian-Echeverri-er6dc3)
