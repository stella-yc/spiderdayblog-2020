**Entomologists of Color** is an awesome organization working to support BIPOC scientists in entomology and arachnology. They sponsor students membership fees for professional societies, provide resources, match trainees with mentors, and more! 

Each month, they feature a new BIPOC scientist, and it's really cool to see myself there alongside the other amazing entomologists and arachnologists!

Please check out their work and how you can get involved at [entopoc.org](https://www.entopoc.org/).
