Hi! I'm Sebastian Alejandro Echeverri. I am a scientist, science communicator, and wildlife photographer. 

And I'm thrilled to announce that I am the co-host of the new [BBC Earth Podcast](https://www.bbcearth.com/podcast)! 

My mission is to spark curiosity in the natural world, and make science (and spiders!) more accessible, inclusive, and joyful for people of all ages and backgrounds.
