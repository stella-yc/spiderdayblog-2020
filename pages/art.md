## My Photography

![](/static/img/photos.jpg "A gallery of Sebastian's photos of spiders, millipedes, pelicans, butterflies, flowers, snakes, landscapes etc.")

I love using my camera to explore nature! You can find my [photography portfolio here](https://lightroom.adobe.com/shares/a81e891b276843d5b7bcc344ab94a8c2). If you're looking for (all of) the spider photos, [those are here](https://lightroom.adobe.com/shares/c281c904082444e39304f9050ea549fb). (I also have a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/saecheverri/) with some of my older photos, but I am in the process of moving hostings).

## My Gear

For macro photography, I use a Nikon D7500 body and a Laowa 100mm 2x macro lens. I light my shots with a Laowa Twin-flash and a homemade diffuser. Previously, I used a NEEWER Speedlite 750ii, and [this diffuser](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1499346-REG/angler_psfd_100_portable_speedlight_flash_diffuser.html) from B&H. For larger subjects, I use a Tamron 16-300mm telephoto.

If you are interested in macro photography on a budget, check out [my workshop on Smartphone Macro Photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qc9PCB5_tM)! There are very decent clip-on macro lenses for your phones available on Amazon. Search "clip-on macro lens." There are a lot of options, but if you can find it, I am enjoying the Apexel 100mm lens. It was ~$30 when I got it. 

## Illustration

I am also learning natural history-style illustration! Currently, I'm working with pen (PaperMate InkJoy 300) on paper, and digitally with Adobe Fresco via a Surface Pro 4 tablet.
