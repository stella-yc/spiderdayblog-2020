## Photography

I love using my camera to explore nature! You can find my [photography portfolio here](https://lightroom.adobe.com/shares/a81e891b276843d5b7bcc344ab94a8c2). If you're looking for just (all) of the spider photos, [those are here](https://lightroom.adobe.com/shares/c281c904082444e39304f9050ea549fb). (I also have a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/saecheverri/) with some of my older photos, but I am in the process of moving hostings).

For macro photography, I use a Nikon D7500 body, a set of Kenko extension tubes, and either a Nikon 18-55mm or 50-200mm lens. I light my shots with a NEEWER Speedlite 750ii, and am currently using [this diffuser](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1499346-REG/angler_psfd_100_portable_speedlight_flash_diffuser.html) from B&H. For larger subjects, I use a Tamron 16-300mm telephoto.

If you are interested in macro photography, but are on a budget, there are very decent clip-on macro lenses for your smartphone available on Amazon. Search "clip-on macro lens" - usually they are ~15\$ dollars.

## Illustration

I am also learning natural history-style illustration. Currently, I'm working with pen (PaperMate InkJoy 300) on paper.
