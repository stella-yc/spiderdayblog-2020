My favorite part of being a scientist is making science accessible and exciting! I believe that science - both as a career, and a casual interest - is for everyone, and quality science communication is critical to making this idea true. As a Hispanic immigrant, I am also committed to making sure that people of all backgrounds feel represented and welcomed in science.

## Outreach

For the past six years, I've been building fun ways to connect people to science. Between classroom visits, museum activity stations, guest lectures, and afterschool programs, I've designed and presented educational experiences for students of every age, from Pre-K to adults and everyone in between.

I have a collection of wonderful outreach spiders (and other arachnids) that have joined me for shows at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, Pittsburgh Children's Museum, local schools, and learners across the world via streaming video.

**If you would like to book a virtual Spider Show for your classroom, birthday, or other event, please get in touch (**email spiderdaynightlive \[at] gmail \[dot] com**) for rates and details!**

## Science Journalism

I love turning complex science into engaging stories! In 2019, I worked as a science reporter at the *Philadelphia Inquirer* as part of the AAAS Mass Media program. I covered everything from terraforming mars, the invention of snail-inspired superglue, to the spider science behind Spider-Man's powers. You can find [all of my stories here](https://www.inquirer.com/author/echeverri_sebastian/), and [my favorite one here](https://www.inquirer.com/science/volunteer-scientists-philadelphia-rare-pennsylvanian-purseweb-spider-mystery-animal-atypus-snetsingeri-20190824.html). It's about a rare spider that is literally "West Philadelphia, born and raised", and the dedicated volunteers studying it!

While in Philly, I also worked as an assistant producer and guest host for an episode of the Science History Institute's podcast, *Distillations*! We explored the saga of science, corruption, and history behind [how Philly gets and uses its water](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/how-philadelphias-water-pollution-problems-shaped-the-city).

Throughout my PhD, I also covered breaking research by livetweeting the scientific conferences I attended. Take a digital trip through some of the exciting science presented at [SICB 2020](http://bit.do/SAE-SICB2020-Tweets), [Arachnology 2019](http://bit.do/SAE-Arachno19-Tweet), and [Animal Behavior 2018](http://bit.do/SAE-ABS2018-Tweets)!

## Teaching

During my PhD, I also completed a Minor in Teaching, and have built my skills through extensive direct experience in the classroom. I worked as a teaching assistant for 10 semesters, across a variety of undergraduate biology courses, including Ecology, Evolution, Genetics, Wildlife Management, and Conservation Biology. I have taught in small seminars, large-enrollment courses, and even field courses! I've also developed 4 lessons of my own⁠—ranging from effective science communication to the role of animal senses in conservation⁠—which I delivered as a guest lecturer for other professors. 

You can learn more about my teaching philosophy, see examples of my course materials, and see student feedback in [my teaching portfolio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBVH9k1tu4Z6eVYAyYGGpq5pKoPoyZ9Y/view?usp=sharing).
