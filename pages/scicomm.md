My favorite part of being a scientist is making science accessible and fun for everyone! I've been doing SciComm since 2015. Whether it's in-person, on a video call, in a podcast, or on TV, I am always down to get people hyped about weird animals and cool science. And as a first-generation Colombian immigrant, I love showing that brown people belong in science and media!

## Outreach

Between classroom visits, museum events, guest lectures, and afterschool programs, I've designed and presented educational experiences for students of every age, from Pre-K to adults and everyone in between. 

I have a collection of wonderful outreach spiders (and other arachnids) that have joined me for shows at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, Pittsburgh Children's Museum, local schools, and learners across the world via streaming video. You can meet some of them in my [digital classroom visit via Skype a Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihsniD3OR7g&list=PL8tSTx4kQ65mLlIegtZijwPdBsm3haGYj&index=5)!

## Science Journalism

![The tarantula's name is Isabel, btw.](/static/img/20190717-img_8396.jpg "Sebastian in the Philly Inquirer newsroom, holding an issue of his story on Spider-Man's powers. On the table is his pet tarantula.")

I love turning complex science into engaging stories! In 2019, I worked as a science reporter at the *Philadelphia Inquirer* as part of the AAAS Mass Media program. I covered everything from terraforming mars, the invention of snail-inspired superglue, to the spider science behind Spider-Man's powers. You can find [all of my stories here](https://www.inquirer.com/author/echeverri_sebastian/), and [my favorite one here](https://www.inquirer.com/science/volunteer-scientists-philadelphia-rare-pennsylvanian-purseweb-spider-mystery-animal-atypus-snetsingeri-20190824.html). It's about a rare spider that is literally "West Philadelphia, born and raised", and the dedicated volunteers studying it!

While in Philly, I also worked as an assistant producer and guest host for an episode of the Science History Institute's podcast, *Distillations*! We explored the saga of science, corruption, and history behind [how Philly gets and uses its water](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/how-philadelphias-water-pollution-problems-shaped-the-city).

Recently, I've done some freelance reporting as well. This year, I covered [the unbelievable life-cycle and evolution of periodical cicadas](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/get-ready-brood-x-every-17-years-cicada-swarm-coming-rcna429) for NBC Digital News.

Throughout my PhD, I also covered breaking research by livetweeting the scientific conferences I attended. Take a digital trip through some of the exciting science presented at [SICB 2020](http://bit.do/SAE-SICB2020-Tweets), [Arachnology 2019](http://bit.do/SAE-Arachno19-Tweet), and [Animal Behavior 2018](http://bit.do/SAE-ABS2018-Tweets)!

## Teaching

During my PhD, I also completed a Minor in Teaching, and have built my skills through extensive direct experience in the classroom. I've worked as a teaching assistant for 10 semesters, across a variety of undergraduate biology courses, including Ecology, Evolution, Genetics, Wildlife Management, and Conservation Biology. I have taught in small seminars, large-enrollment courses, and even field courses! I've also developed 4 lessons of my own⁠—ranging from effective science communication to the role of animal senses in conservation⁠—which I delivered as a guest lecturer for other professors. 

You can learn more about my teaching philosophy, see examples of my course materials, and see student feedback in [my teaching portfolio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBVH9k1tu4Z6eVYAyYGGpq5pKoPoyZ9Y/view?usp=sharing).
