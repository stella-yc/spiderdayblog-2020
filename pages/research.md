I am interested in the complex relationship between animals’ eyes, their environment, and how they use color, shape, and movement to communicate with each other.

### Current Research

## How do tarantula eyes evolve when species adapt to different lifestyles?

Check back soon for more on this project!

### PhD Research

For a full presentation of my research, check out my [PhD defense on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQAAh4lfF78&t=416s)! You can also find a PDF of my [dissertation here](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/37706/).

## How does how animals position themselves change how they can communicate?

The way that animals--including us--communicate with each other is affected by where we are: our relative distance, direction, and location in the environment. Eyes, ears, noses, and other sensory organs have built-in spatial ("spacing-based") limitations. For example, you can't see behind yourself, its easier to smell something the nearer it gets, and it's harder to listen to a conversation in a loud room. Likewise, the ways we've evolved use colors + shapes, sound, and smells to communicate also face spatial challenges. Try reading a letter that is very far away from you, is turned to face away from you, or is in a dark room. When positioning isn't quite right for either end of the conversation (the sensory organ or the signal), you might miss out on part of the message (Fig 1).

> **Figure 1.** For paradise jumping spiders (genus *Habronattus*) whether or not a dancing males' lovely colors can be seen by his female audience depends on how both animals position themselves. Males' colors can only be seen from the front, and only the spiders' forward-facing primary eyes can see in color. Photos and spider illustrations by Daniel Zurek.

Because it can be much easier to communicate if both the presenter and their audience move into the right positions, animals might be under pressure to evolve ways to make sure this happens. But, for a long time, we haven't studied this important part of communication. In the first part of my PhD, I reviewed the reasons behind the spatial limitations on sensors and signals, what (little) we know about how animals position themselves, and how we can use new technology to learn more.

## When paradise spiders dance, where does their audience look?

Male fiery-haired paradise spiders (*Habronattus pyrrithrix*) put on a [spectacular song and dance show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEQ3KM4tKLc) to impress females, but there's a potential problem. Males' colors can only be seen from the front, and while the spiders' eight eyes give them an almost 360-degree field of view, some of those eyes see differently. Only the spiders' forward-facing primary eyes can see in color and in high-resolution. Their multiple pairs of secondary eyes are great for detecting movement, but see in black-and-white and blurrier. So, what she sees depends on how both spiders move (Fig 1)!

How big of a problem is this? By tracking the behavior of males and females during courtship, I discovered that, on average, females can see a male’s colors only 30% of the time! While males always aimed their dancing towards females, females often turned to face elsewhere (perhaps watching for predators, or prey). In the second part of their courtship, males seem to wait until females are watching before showing off their more impressive dance moves.

I published this research in Behavioral Ecology ([Echeverri et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/28/6/1445/4091426)), and it was covered by [Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/jumping-spiders-dance-moves).

## How best to catch her (primary) eyes?

To increase the chances that his colors are visible, *H. pyrrithrix* males may have evolved ways to get females to turn and face him.  In the first part of their dance, males repeatedly wave their 1st pair of legs up and down, just like we might flag down someone from a distance. But, what's going on around the male might change how easily he stands out.

By asking female spiders to choose between looking at animations of waving and non-waving males presented on different backgrounds, I learned that these movements are an excellent way of getting her attention. And, by filming real males courting females in front of the same backgrounds, I discovered that these spiders change how they dance in response to their surroundings! When far away, males make bigger waves, and when the background is more distracting, they move closer to the female. 

### Undergraduate Research



### When birds evolve to build together, who helps, and why?



We think that males have evolved ways to get females to turn around and face him. Males wave their front pair of legs back and forth when approaching a female - just like we might wave to someone from across a room! We are currently testing whether jumping spider waves work in the same way to get a female’s attention.

## Color vision across the ages: Metamorphic changes in frog eyes

Do children and adults see color in the same way, and why or why not? How animals have evolved to see colors depends on what sort of things they need use their vision to do. Different animals have different lifestyles, and live in different places; different activities and environments make color vision more or less useful. So, as animals adapt to a new lifestyle, their color vision might change over a long period of time. But, many animals experience dramatic lifestyle changes throughout just an individual lifetime! Some frogs, for example, start off as herbivorous tadpoles living in murky water, and grow up to be predators hopping around on land. Each of these life stages might need different eye adaptations, but we don’t know very much about how such changes might affect color vision. What colors an individual can tell apart may depend on their age, and the same color might be perceived differently throughout a lifetime. I am beginning a project to understand how the photoreceptors in frogs’ eyes change as they metamorphose from tadpoles to adult. Whether or not color vision changes may depend on how big of a lifestyle shift a frog species experiences - frogs that remain aquatic as adults may have different changes than frogs that go from aquatic to terrestrial.
