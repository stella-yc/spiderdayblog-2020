I am interested in the complex relationship between animals’ eyes, their environment, and how they use color, shape, and movement to talk with each other.

### Current Research

## How do tarantulas' eyes change when species adapt to different habitats?

Animals' environment and lifestyle can shape how their eyes evolve. For example, species might evolve eyes that are good at seeing at night, or to have wide-set eyes to watch for predators in open and exposed environments.  While most tarantulas live in burrows in the ground, several species have independently adapted to living in trees.  Tarantulas have relatively small eyes compared to many other spiders, but people who keep pet tarantulas have noticed that the arboreal species *seem* to have larger eyes than their terrestrial cousins. I am working to test this idea, along with a high school student that I am mentoring. 

### PhD Research

## How does how animals position themselves change how they can communicate?

The way that animals--including us--communicate with each other is affected by where we are: our relative distance, direction, and location in the environment. Eyes, ears, noses, and other sensory organs have built-in spatial ("spacing-based") limitations. For example, you can't see behind yourself, its easier to smell something the nearer it gets, and it's harder to listen to a conversation in a loud room. Likewise, the ways we've evolved use colors + shapes, sound, and smells to communicate also face spatial challenges. Try reading a letter that is very far away from you, is turned to face away from you, or is in a dark room. When positioning isn't quite right for either end of the conversation (the sensory organ or the signal), you might miss out on part of the message (Fig 1).

Males' colors can only be seen from the front, and only the spiders' forward-facing primary eyes can see in color. Photos and spider illustrations by Dr. Daniel Zurek.

Because it can be much easier to communicate if both the presenter and their audience move into the right positions, animals might be under pressure to evolve ways to make sure this happens. But, for a long time, we haven't studied this important part of communication. In the first part of my PhD, I reviewed the reasons behind the spatial limitations on sensors and signals, what (little) we know about how animals position themselves, and how we can use new technology to learn more.

## When paradise spiders dance, where does their audience look?

Male fiery-haired paradise spiders (*Habronattus pyrrithrix*) put on a [spectacular song and dance show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEQ3KM4tKLc) to impress females, but there's a potential problem. Males' colors can only be seen from the front, and while the spiders' eight eyes give them an almost 360-degree field of view, some of those eyes see differently. Only the spiders' forward-facing primary eyes can see in color and in high-resolution. Their multiple pairs of secondary eyes are great for detecting movement, but see in black-and-white and blurrier. So, what she sees depends on how both spiders move (Fig 1)!

How big of a problem is this? By tracking the behavior of males and females during courtship, I discovered that, on average, females can see a male’s colors only 30% of the time! While males always aimed their dancing towards females, females often turned to face elsewhere (perhaps watching for predators, or prey). In the second part of their courtship, males seem to wait until females are watching before showing off their more impressive dance moves.

I published this research in Behavioral Ecology ([Echeverri et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/28/6/1445/4091426)), and it was covered by [Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/jumping-spiders-dance-moves).

## How best to catch her (primary) eyes?

To increase the chances that his colors are visible, *H. pyrrithrix* males may have evolved ways to get females to turn and face him.  In the first part of their dance, males repeatedly wave their 1st pair of legs up and down, just like we might flag down someone from a distance. But, what's going on around the male might change how easily he stands out.

By asking female spiders to choose between looking at animations of waving and non-waving males presented on different backgrounds, I learned that these movements are an excellent way of getting her attention. And, by filming real males courting females in front of the same backgrounds, I discovered that these spiders change how they dance in response to their surroundings! When far away, males make bigger leg movemnts, and when the background is more distracting, they dance from closer to the female. 

### Undergraduate Research

## When birds evolve to build together, who helps, and why?

During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant for Dr. Gavin Leighton, who was studying how sociable weaverbirds (*Philetairus socius*) work together. These birds, found in southern Africa, live in large colonies and build absolutely massive straw nests that can eventually topple the *Acacia* trees they use for scaffolding. We learned that these [nests help keep the birds warm in the desert nights](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3184/175815514X14151918723245), [hidden details of their diet](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3184/175815515X14289391219157), [how birds move between colonies](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-015-1307-1.pdf), and that [birds who are more related to their group do more building](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-015-1996-8)!
